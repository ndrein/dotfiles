# dotfiles

Hi, this is the home directory of my files.  It's also the repository for my dotfiles (configuration etc.).

## Branches

The master branch contains the configuration for my main computer.  My best configuration goes here.

All other branches should be machine-specific (eg. waterloo-linux).


## startup-scripts

Contains my custom startup scripts, such as `alias` information and shell functions.  See the README.md there for more information.
